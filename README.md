# The Meal DB
The Meal DB web application displays a list of meals that provided by an external [API] (https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?a=chinese). The users can like a meal, leave some comments or make a reservation, in these cases an involvement API will be used.

N.B. The reservation functions are not implemented because we were two.
